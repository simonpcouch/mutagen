This repository contains source code demonstrating a tidymodels machine learning pipeline for prediction of drug mutagenicity.

* `source/` contains scripts to propose, fit, and evaluate a number of machine learning models.
* `data/` contains summarized output from these scripts, for use in the write-up of the process.
* `data-raw/` contains raw output from these scripts and is not tracked, as these files are quite large.
